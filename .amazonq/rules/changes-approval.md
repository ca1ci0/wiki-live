# Changes Approval Rule

## File Modification Policy

Do not update project files until receiving approval.

## Process

When planning to update project files:

1. Describe the proposed changes clearly
2. Ask for approval before proceeding
3. Wait for response:
    - **"y"** or **"yes"** → Proceed with changes
    - **"n"** or **"no"** → Ask what modifications are needed
    - Any other response → Clarify requirements

## Implementation

Always ask "Should I proceed with these changes?" before using file modification tools.
